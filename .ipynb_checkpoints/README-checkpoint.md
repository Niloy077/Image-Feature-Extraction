# Image-Feature-Extraction
COCO Feature Extraction with Pretrained Models
Overview
This project extracts image features from the COCO 2017 validation dataset using pretrained deep learning models like ResNet101, GoogLeNet, and ZFNet (AlexNet alternative). The extracted features are used to find the 10 nearest neighbors for selected object classes.

Dataset

Extracted features are used to compare results across multiple models.

Project Workflow
Download & Extract the COCO dataset.
Load Annotations and select images from specific classes: person, car, dog, cat, airplane, bottle.
Apply Transformations and load images into a PyTorch DataLoader.
Load Pretrained Models and remove the last fully connected layer.
Extract Features and compute Euclidean distance to find similar images.
Visualize Nearest Neighbors for each class.
